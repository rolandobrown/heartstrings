#Intro from Stacey & Rolando

-Loved one, there are things I want to tell you, someday... (message bubble)
-There is a loved one in my future... (message bubble)

We want to express love...
We want to receive love...
We want to belong.

We want to be remembered.
We want to remember.

We want to prepare our loved ones.
We want to help others do the same.

Google gave us search..
Facebook gave us connection...
We hope Hearstrings can give us keepsakes.

If everyone on the internet is finding and manipulating strings, let's make them a bunch of heartstrings.
